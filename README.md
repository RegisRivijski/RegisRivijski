# Hi, I’m @RegisRivijski

I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient, and scalable code. My passion lies in creating powerful backend systems and crafting seamless user experiences.

### Projects

1. **Gacha Simulator** - [telegram](https://t.me/genshinGachaSimulatorBot)

   A distributed system consisting of three microservices designed to simulate gacha mechanics inspired by games like Genshin Impact:

   - **[Gacha Simulator Telegram Bot](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-tg-bot)**: Acts as a proxy, enabling the creation of multiple bots with distinct API keys while maintaining unified functionality and a shared database.
   - **[Gacha Simulator REST API](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-rest)**: The main business logic of the application.
   - **[Gacha Simulator Static Data](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-static-data)**: Creates static data for the main business logic service, such as characters, weapons, banner, prices, etc. Also responsible for rendering the images used in the bot.
   - **[Gacha Simulator Admin Frontend](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-admin-front)**: Admin panel for managing banners, promocodes, advertisements, and other system content. Built with Vue.js to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators.
