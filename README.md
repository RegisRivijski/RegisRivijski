# Hi, I’m @RegisRivijski

I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient, and scalable code. My passion lies in creating powerful backend systems and crafting seamless user experiences.

### Projects

I have developed multiple projects, including:

1. **Gacha Simulator** - [telegram](https://t.me/genshinGachaSimulatorBot)

   A distributed system consisting of three microservices designed to simulate gacha mechanics inspired by games like Genshin Impact:

   - **[Gacha Simulator Telegram Bot](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-tg-bot)**: User-facing interface for performing gacha pulls and managing in-game profiles via Telegram.
   - **[Gacha Simulator REST API](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-rest)**: Core business logic for gacha mechanics and user data management.
   - **[Gacha Simulator Static Data](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-static-data)**: Manages character and weapon metadata, localized content, and banner images. 
   - **[Gacha Simulator Admin Frontend](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-admin-front)**: Admin panel for managing banners, promocodes, advertisements, and other system content. Built with Vue.js to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators.

2. **War Alert** - [telegram](https://t.me/war_alert_now_bot)

   A Telegram bot that notifies users about air raid alerts in Ukraine. It sends real-time updates, lists active and safe regions, and integrates with external APIs for accurate data.

   - **[War Alert Telegram Bot](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/war-alert-tg-bot)**: A monolithic bot built with **Telegraf**.

3. **English IT Vocabulary** - [web application](https://artur-petrov.vinnica.ua/quiz/)

   A comprehensive application designed to help users improve their IT-related English vocabulary. The project consists of two main parts:

   - **[Frontend](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/vue-quiz)**: Built with **Vue.js 3** for a modern, responsive interface. Features include state management with **Vuex**, API integration using **Axios**, and real-time notifications with **Vue Toastification**.
   - **[Backend](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/quiz-rest)**: Developed with **Koa.js** and **MySQL**, featuring **JWT authentication** for secure sessions and database migrations for easy deployment.
