# Hi, I’m @RegisRivijski

I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient, and scalable code. My passion lies in creating powerful backend systems and crafting seamless user experiences.

### Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Specializing in JavaScript with a focus on Node.js for backend development and Vue.js for building interactive frontends.
- **Database Management**: Experienced with MongoDB and MySQL for handling complex datasets and ensuring efficient data retrieval.
- **Performance Optimization**: Skilled in refactoring legacy code, improving system performance, and integrating external APIs.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Proficient in designing scalable microservices and managing RESTful APIs for dynamic applications.

### Projects

I have developed multiple projects, including:

1. **Gacha Simulator** - [telegram](https://t.me/genshinGachaSimulatorBot)

   A distributed system consisting of three microservices designed to simulate gacha mechanics inspired by games like Genshin Impact:

   - **[Gacha Simulator Telegram Bot](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-tg-bot)**: User-facing interface for performing gacha pulls and managing in-game profiles via Telegram.
   - **[Gacha Simulator REST API](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-rest)**: Core business logic for gacha mechanics and user data management.
   - **[Gacha Simulator Static Data](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-static-data)**: Manages character and weapon metadata, localized content, and banner images. 
   - **[Gacha Simulator Admin Frontend](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/gacha-simulator-admin-front)**: Admin panel for managing banners, promocodes, advertisements, and other system content. Built with Vue.js to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators.

3. **[War Alert Telegram Bot (github)](https://github.com/RegisRivijski/war-alert-tg-bot)** - [telegram](https://t.me/war_alert_now_bot)

   A Telegram bot designed to notify users about air raid alerts in Ukraine.

   - Sends real-time notifications about active alerts to the Telegram channel.
   - Provides a list of active and safe regions upon request.
   - Integrates with external APIs to fetch accurate and up-to-date alert data.

Each of these projects demonstrates my expertise in creating scalable and modular solutions using modern technologies like Node.js, Redis, and MongoDB.
